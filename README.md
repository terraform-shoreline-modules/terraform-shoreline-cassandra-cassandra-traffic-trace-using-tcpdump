### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Cassandra Traffic Trace Using tcpdump
---

This incident type involves tracing the network traffic associated with Cassandra, a distributed NoSQL database management system. The purpose of this trace is to diagnose any issues or potential problems with the database's performance, security, or availability. Tcpdump, a command-line packet analyzer, is commonly used to capture and analyze this network traffic data. This analysis can help identify issues such as slow query response times, network latency, or security threats.

### Parameters
```shell
export INTERFACE="PLACEHOLDER"

export CASSANDRA_PORT="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_CASSANDRA_YAML_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Capture Cassandra traffic on a specific network interface
```shell
sudo tcpdump -i ${INTERFACE} port ${CASSANDRA_PORT} -w cassandra_traffic.pcap
```

### View captured traffic in real-time
```shell
sudo tcpdump -i ${INTERFACE} port ${CASSANDRA_PORT} -A
```

### Check if Cassandra is running
```shell
nodetool status
```

### Check Cassandra's system log for errors
```shell
tail -f /var/log/cassandra/system.log
```

### Monitor Cassandra's performance metrics (requires nodetool)
```shell
watch -n 1 nodetool cfstats
```

### Analyze captured traffic with Wireshark
```shell
wireshark cassandra_traffic.pcap
```

### Check Cassandra's JVM heap usage (requires nodetool)
```shell
nodetool info | grep HeapMemoryUsage
```

## Repair

### Check if the Cassandra cluster is properly configured. Ensure that there are no configuration errors in the Cassandra.yaml file.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the path to the Cassandra configuration file

CASSANDRA_CONFIG=${PATH_TO_CASSANDRA_YAML_FILE}



# Check if the configuration file exists

if [ -f $CASSANDRA_CONFIG ]; then

  echo "Cassandra configuration file found at $CASSANDRA_CONFIG"

else

  echo "Cassandra configuration file not found at $CASSANDRA_CONFIG"

  exit 1

fi



# Check if there are any syntax errors in the configuration file

CONFIG_ERRORS=$(cassandra -f -C $CASSANDRA_CONFIG 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -i 'Error' | wc -l)



if [ $CONFIG_ERRORS -gt 0 ]; then

  echo "Cassandra configuration file has syntax errors"

  exit 1

else

  echo "Cassandra configuration file is valid"

fi



exit 0
